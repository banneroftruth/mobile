We must go the way of the cross. This is why so many who profess to believe in Jesus and to be followers of him lead lives that show little or no spiritual fruit, because they still love their lives. We may reckon this to be a mystery, but it is a mystery which is easily solved. The truth is vouched for and beautifully set forth by Paul in 2 Corinthians 4:10, 11. We only experience the resurrection power of Christ by carrying around in ourselves the death of Jesus, thus mortifying all in our lives which opposes his life. Those who do become a fragrance of life to those who have his life, and a smell of death to those who neither have his life nor want it (<em>2 Cor.<\/em> 2:15, 16).<\/p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">Christ\u2019s death\/resurrection sequence not only brings him through to immortal manhood, but it also brings us to spiritual life in certain hope of the same immortal humanity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">More than that, as we die our personal spiritual deaths by following him in costly obedience, the influence and witness of our lives has the same effect on others. As a result of our dying to self and sin, the seed of the Word of God is planted in those who respond to the challenge. This is described eloquently in 2 Corinthians 4:12: \u2018Death at work in us, but life at work in others\u2019. We are to take up our cross and follow, for only thus shall there be fruit. We will see fruit not only in our own character but in others, too, as they come to birth and life in him\u2014even eternal life.<\/p>\n<p>  <!--BOOK--><!--THROUGHTHEYEARWITHWILLIAMSTILL--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/through-the-year-with-william-still\/\"><em>Through the Year With William Still<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20842],"class_list":["post-133022","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-through-the-year-with-william-still"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Losing life to find it - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Losing life to find it\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"1 August \u2018The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be.
