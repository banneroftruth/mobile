Though he cannot but take sorrowful notice of what passes around him, he is more ready to scrutinize and blame his own misconduct, than that of other men. He confesses that his best is defective and defiled. Though he exercises himself to maintain a conscience void of offence, and dares appeal to the Lord for the sincerity of his aims, he owns that in everything he comes short. His obligations to the Redeemer are immense, and his sensations of gratitude, and exertions in service, are vastly disproportionate to them: yet, having accepted the atonement, and resting his hope of salvation upon Jesus, though his imperfections humble him, they do not discourage him. But he acknowledges that, if justice were strict to mark what is amiss, his own sins are so many and so great, that he could have no right to complain, though he had a large share of the heaviest calamities incident to this mortal life. They who are thus minded, are the chariots and horsemen of the land in which they live. They sigh and mourn for their own sins, and the evils which they cannot prevent. They have little thanks from the blind, careless, ungodly many around them. They are rather scorned and despised for their singularity, and unfashionable preciseness; but, if this nation be spared from destruction, it will be for their sakes, and for the attention with which God regards their prayers. If we had no such persons among us, our fleets and armies would prove but a poor and precarious defence. But I trust their number is not small. They are dispersed up and down throughout the kingdom, and are the salt of the earth, which preserves us from total putrefaction. <\/p>\n<p class=\"source\" style=\"padding-top: 1em;padding: 2em;text-align: center\">The Danger and Resource of this Nation, [5:281]; 3:655<\/p>\n<p><!--BOOK--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/jewels-from-john-newton\/\"><em>Jewels From John Newton<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20843],"class_list":["post-133030","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-jewels-from-john-newton"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>7 August - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"7 August\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.\u2014Dan. 9:16.
