The Holy One is still in the midst of us! Degenerate and wicked as we are, God has a people, a remnant among us. I have spoken of these already. Their number is small if compared with the bulk of the nation; but, if they could be collected together, they would form a considerable body, (I trust it is an increasing body), who, though distinguished by different names, and dispersed far and wide into different parts of the land, are united, by a faith of divine operation, to one Head, and in one common interest and design. They belong to that kingdom which is not of this world, and which (unlike all other kingdoms) cannot be shaken. But their principles lead them to seek the welfare of the communities in which they live. These, are, under God \u2026 the glory and the defence of Great Britain. They are lights shining in a dark place. They are believers, and their faith worketh by love. But as they follow the example of their Lord and Master, the world knows not them, because it knows not him\u2026 But their record is on high. They have access to God and communion with him, by the Son of his love. They have the spirit of prayer, and their prayers are heard. The ship in which Paul sailed to Italy, was preserved from sinking, though apparently in the utmost danger, because the apostle was on board her. The state ship of this nation is now in jeopardy, she is brought into deep waters, tossed with tempests, and her rowers are almost at their wits\u2019 end; but there is a precious <em>depositum<\/em> on board. A people dear to the Lord are embarked in the same bottom with the rest, and we hope their prayers will prevail for the safety of the whole. <\/p>\n<p class=\"source\" style=\"padding-top: 1em;padding: 2em;text-align: center\">Motives to Humiliation and Praise, [5:297]; 3:667<\/p>\n<p><!--BOOK--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/jewels-from-john-newton\/\"><em>Jewels From John Newton<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20843],"class_list":["post-133031","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-jewels-from-john-newton"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>8 August - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"8 August\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"And Abraham drew near, and said,Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\u2014Gen. 18:23. \u2018I AM the Holy One in the midst of thee.\u2019 Next to the consideration of his infinite mercy, this is our strongest ground for consolation.
