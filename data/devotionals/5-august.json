This confession suits us all, and is readily made by all who know themselves. A person approaching London from the neighbouring hills, usually sees it obscured by a cloud of smoke. This cloud is the aggregate of the smoke, to which every house furnishes its respective quota. It is no unfit emblem of the sin and the misery which abound in this great metropolis. The Lord said of the Amorites, at a certain period, \u2018Their iniquity is not yet full.\u2019 I hope the measure of our iniquity is not yet full; but it is filling every day, and we are all daily contributing to fill it. True believers, though, by grace, delivered from the reigning power of sin, are still sinners. In many things we offend all in thought, word, and deed. We are now called upon to humble ourselves before God, for the sins of our ignorance, and for the more aggravated sins we have committed against light and experience; for those personal sins, the record of which is known only to God and our consciences; for the defects and defilements of our best services; for our great and manifold failures in the discharge of our relative duties, as parents, children, husbands, wives, masters, or servants, and as members of the community. Our dullness in the ways of God, our alertness in the pursuit of our own will and way; our indifference to what concerns his glory, compared with the quickness of our apprehensions, when our own temporal interests are affected, are so many proofs of our ingratitude and depravity. The sins of the Lord\u2019s own people are so many, and so heightened by the consideration of his known goodness, that, if he was to enter into judgment with them only, they could offer no other plea than that which he has so mercifully provided for them,\u2014\u2018If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquity, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.\u2019 <\/p>\n<p class=\"source\" style=\"padding-top: 1em;padding: 2em;text-align: center\">The Danger and Resource of this Nation, [5:258]; 3:638<\/p>\n<p><!--BOOK--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/jewels-from-john-newton\/\"><em>Jewels From John Newton<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20843],"class_list":["post-133028","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-jewels-from-john-newton"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 August - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"5 August\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
