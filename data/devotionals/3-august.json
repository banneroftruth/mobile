They repented at the preaching of Jonah, and immediately, on their first hearing him; and they sought for mercy upon a peradventure, when they could say no more, than, Who can tell, whether there may be the least room to hope for it, after what the prophet has so solemnly declared?<\/p>\n<p>God does not speak to us by the audible voice of an inspired prophet; nor is it necessary. We know, or may know, from his written word, that it shall be well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked. The appearance of an angel from heaven could add nothing to the certainty of the declarations he has already put into our hands. He has likewise raised up, and perpetuated a succession of his ministers, to enforce the warnings he has given us in the Scripture; to remind us of our sins, and the sure and dreadful consequences, if we persist in them. Nor are we left at an uncertainty as to the event, if we humbly confess them, and implore forgiveness, in the way which he has prescribed. The gospel, the glorious gospel of the blessed God, is preached unto us. Jesus Christ, as crucified, is set forth among us. His blood cleanseth from all sin; and they who believe in him are freed from condemnation, and completely justified. They have also free access to a throne of grace, and, like Israel, they have power, by prayer, to prevail with God and with man. And shall it be said of any of us, that the Lord gave us space to repent, and invited us to repentance, and we repented not? May his mercy forbid it! <\/p>\n<p class=\"source\" style=\"padding-top: 1em;padding: 2em;text-align: center\">The Danger and Resource of this Nation, [5:252]; 3:634<\/p>\n<p><!--BOOK--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/jewels-from-john-newton\/\"><em>Jewels From John Newton<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20843],"class_list":["post-133026","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-jewels-from-john-newton"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>3 August - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"3 August\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\u2014Matt. 12:41.
