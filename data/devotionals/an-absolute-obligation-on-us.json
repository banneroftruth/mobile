He proceeded to explain to them what he had done, and why. Whether the once-for-all cleansing of regeneration (see verse 10) or the daily, oft-repeated forgiveness referred to in these verses, the washing was his sole prerogative. \u2018Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\u2019 (<em>Acts <\/em>4:12).<\/p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">What he does for us in our servant sphere we must do for others. This is the message he seeks to inculcate, and it is an exceedingly challenging one. If the Teacher and Master stoops to minister to the simplest needs of his servants, and becomes their Servant (\u2018I am among you as one who serves\u2019, <em>Luke <\/em>22:27), surely it is not too much to expect that his children will take pleasure in serving each other. How hardly learned is this lesson! So our Lord emphasises the point: I have set you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"body\" style=\"text-indent: 2em\">Consider further his challenge to obedience. Re-reading the final sentence of this passage (verse 16), one\u2019s thoughts are directed not only to the Lord\u2019s gracious command to us his disciples and servants, but also to his Father commanding him, for the Father is \u2018the one who sent him\u2019. The perfect submission of the equal Son to the Father is a wonderful relationship and it provides a paradigm which imposes absolute obligation on our Lord\u2019s disciples. Though Christ was a man on earth, his status with the Father and his submission to him were the unanswerable argument for Christ\u2019s followers\u2019 perfect submission both to him and to each other.<\/p>\n<p>  <!--BOOK--><!--THROUGHTHEYEARWITHWILLIAMSTILL--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>\n\tThis week\u2019s devotionals are from <a href=\"https:\/\/banneroftruth.org\/store\/devotionalsdaily-readings\/through-the-year-with-william-still\/\"><em>Through the Year With William Still<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60740,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"devotional-series":[20839,20842],"class_list":["post-133023","devotional","type-devotional","status-publish","hentry","devotional-series-daily-devotional","devotional-series-through-the-year-with-william-still"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.8 (Yoast SEO v25.5) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>An absolute obligation on us - Banner of Truth UK<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"An absolute obligation on us\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"2 August When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. \u2018Do you understand what I have done for you?\u2019 he asked them. 13 \u2018You call me \u201cTeacher\u201d and \u201cLord\u201d, and rightly so, for that is what I am. 14 Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"amp;p=133023\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Banner of Truth UK\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheBannerofTruth\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2015\/09\/1619303_10152009227311976_3978164821797516248_n.jpg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@Banneroftruth\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"p=133023\",\"url\":\"p=133023\",\"name\":\"An absolute obligation on us - Banner of Truth UK\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-08-01T23:00:00+00:00\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"p=133023#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"p=133023\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"p=133023#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Devotionals\",\"item\":\"devotional\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"An absolute obligation on us\"}]},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"#website\",\"url\":\"\",\"name\":\"Banner of Truth UK\",\"description\":\"Christian Publisher of Reformed &amp;
